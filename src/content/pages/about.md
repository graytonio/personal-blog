## Grayton Ward - Production Engineer based in Atlanta

**Hey!** I'm Grayton, a passionate engineer based in Atlanta, GA. I have a wide field of interests but currently my focus is on kubernetes and platform services.

## Skills and Expertise

I specialize in backend services and cli based tools offering automations and ease of use features to users.

I'm proficient in a number of languages including golang, rust, python, and javascript and am well versed in technologies like kubernetes, gitops, cloud scaling, and CICD pipeines.

## Innovation and Problem-Solving

I thrive on new and creative challenges that require innovative and robust solutions. Whether it's a performance optimization, adding in large new features, or migrating entire legacy code bases to fresh frameworks I approach each challenge with enthusiasm and dedication to solving the puzzle.

## Continuous Learning

With the pace the industry changes day to day, I believe the most important skill any engineer can have is being able to learn and adapt to new environments. With this I make it a priority to constantly be learning and imporving my skills and sharing that experience with others.

This was the driving idea behind my twitch channel where I take on new challenges every week.
